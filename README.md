My original idea for a high school project (creating a probability-based game for a data management course). 
I dropped it because it wasn't really fun to play, and also would have been a nightmare to analyze statistically.  
It was instead superseded by [Dice Duel](https://klehrik.itch.io/dice-duel).

All the UI elements were written by me from scratch (under objects/Components), as GameMaker has no real UI support.

The font used is a slightly edited version of Theoretical by [somepx](https://somepx.itch.io/) (support their work [here](https://somepx.itch.io/humble-fonts-tiny)!)
